    <h2 class="m-5">Introduction</h2>
  <p>
      That is the Book of which there is no doubt</br>
      a guide for those who are cautious; </br>
      those who believe in the Unseen, </br>
      steadily build Salat </br>
      and who give out from what We have provided them. </br>
      Also those who believe in that which We have lowered unto you </br>
      and what We had lowered before you: </br>
      They are convinced in what comes after. </br>
      It is they who have been put on track by their Lord; </br>
      It is they who are winners.
